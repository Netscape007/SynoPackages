This is a list of "Package Folder" that I have created for my own purpose:
- either by modifying existing Synology Packages (Ex.: 'MODS SSPKS' which is a modification of Julien Del-Piccolo's Simple SPK Server)
- or by creating my own Packages (Ex.: 'MODS Package Manager'which is a package to help in moving packages from a volume to another)

Those 'Package Folders' that can be opened with "Mods Packager" in order to build SPK files (Synology Packages). Briefly said: run "Mods Packager" and open any of those folders, either by using the menu File > Open or by drag&dropping the folder onto Mods Packager's Main UI.
